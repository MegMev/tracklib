This library defines a track event type allowing to define inheritance relations between tracks that contain groups of hits. A process connecting to the detector library allows for hit clustering to create a first set of tracks using a distance relation. Graph theory processes are included in this library in order to identify and reconstruct a physical track, and execute topological algorithms.
